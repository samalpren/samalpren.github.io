            <h2>Application Questions</h2>
                <p class="questions">Why are you applying to Nashville Software School?</p>
                <p class="answers">I found NSS through course report when I was first beginning my research on what bootcamp path I wanted to take. I had it at the top of my list with a few other schools. Some of the other programs and schools would pull rank above it when I was comparing tuitions, enrollment dates, etc, however I kept finding myself back on the NSS website. My brother (he’s a successful software engineer himself) put the bug in me to checkout bootcamps and has been helping me weigh pros and cons. He said something that really stuck with me: <span style="font-style: italic;">"wouldn’t it be nice to be able to ask the person on your right when you’re stuck on a problem, or be able to speak to your teacher?"</span> I spent a lot of time looking at past cohorts and their personal websites, or listening to alumni podcasts and kept getting more and more intrigued by NSS. The curriculum is superb and it’s in my home city. Needless to say NSS is #1 on my list and my dream bootcamp, so I would really love the opportunity to go!</p>
                <p class="questions">What is your background with computer programming? Be as detailed as possible. Feel free to include links to any applications you have built, courses you have taken, etc.</p>
                <p class="answers">I don’t have a long history with programming. When I was young I loved to mess around so I could have the coolest myspace. When WiX first came around I thought I was some sort of wizard building all these websites with flash content for my friends and I. I recently went to visit my brother who gave me a crash course into the real world of programming and I got hooked. Since then I have been having remote meetings with him and also working my way through all of the Codecademy courses with a focus on web development (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) at the moment. Oviously, if you are viewing this application online, you can see that I am trying to put what I have learned so far right into action. Feel free to visit my github account to dig into it!</p>   
                <p class="questions">The ideal candidate is someone who loves to solve problems or tinker and who doesn't easily give up. Can you tell us anything that illustrates these qualities in you?</p>
                <p class="answers">Growing up my family wasn’t very wealthy, so when I had saved enough and was blessed enough to buy my first car - it wasn’t the prettiest or best ride in town, but it had potential. I watched tutorials, read manuals and learned piece by piece how to replace engine parts, remove dents and use different tools to increase its value. I fixed it up during a cold winter and hot summer and sold it for almost double! I'll be approaching this bootcamp and career with the same mentality.</p>
                <p class="questions">The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts)</p>
                <p class="answers">When I was working for YSL we went through a big transition and the HQ was moving to LA from Paris. They wanted to use the West Coast stores as a launching point for all window displays across the globe, and all that fell on my boss’ desk. I had experience with contractors and fabricating the displays I was able to provide, but my boss needed to send exact visual renderings of what the finished product would look like. I excitedly (and foolishly), told him that I could handle it and produce these. I spent everyday after work for one week learning enough in SketchUp to give a presentation of all the West Coast window displays down to the millimeters. They were approved and implemented in every boutique across the world. Most problems we need to solve on a day-to-day are complex, the trick is breaking it down into parts and figuring out how to solve each small problem. Before you know it, you've gone a mile one step at a time and can look back on your completed project.</p>
